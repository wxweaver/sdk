# Icons

Some of the icons used in wxWeaver were made directly by wxFormBuilder developers,
used and shared as part of the application, which is licensed under
the GPL 2.0 license.

Some of the others are taken and modified rispectively from the Nuvola
and Oxygen icon sets, which are both licensed under the LGPL 2.1 license,
included in the same directory of this file.
